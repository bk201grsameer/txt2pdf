# Text to PDF Converter

## Overview
This is a Python script that converts a text file into a PDF document with word wrapping functionality. It utilizes the ReportLab library to generate the PDF.

## Features
- Converts plain text files (.txt) into PDF documents.
- Supports word wrapping to fit text within specified margins.
- Allows customization of margins and text formatting.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- ReportLab library (install via `pip install reportlab`)

## Usage
1. Place your text file (`input.txt`) in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python text_to_pdf.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter the input file path, output folder path, and output file name.
4. The PDF file will be generated in the specified output folder.

## Example
Suppose you have a text file named `sample_text.txt` containing the text you want to convert. You want to generate a PDF named `output.pdf` in the `documents` folder. Here's how you would run the script:

```
Enter the path to the input text file: sample_text.txt
Enter the path to the output folder (leave blank for current folder): documents
Enter the output file name (without extension, e.g., output): output
```
